"First let me begin by saying I’m writing this in a fit of Rage. I’ve been using Netflix through various different accounts for years, always through family members. I’ve seen countless movies and shows and they’ve been worth the $10-16 a month- up until this past year, the disappointment, disgust, anger, confusion- a company so large so vast- THE COMPANY TO SHUT DOWN BLOCKBUSTER? A shame a true shame I tell you now. I can say that the sadness I felt the first time I saw that “member of household” butt crap, was unmatched. I am revolted, I’ve dedicated so much of my life to the good deed of doing right unto others for that is what Jesus would do and this is the thanks I get? Selfishness from those who hold such power? This is abuse, this is an atrocious act against humanity, community, friendship and family across the globe. I can only imagine what kind of vileness and hatred went towards this cowardly and cheapskate act against the good of the people. I just hope that one day you can look back and tell yourself that in the end you did the right thing, the right thing for your countless and I mean COUNTLESS customers, we’re more than customers we’re families we’re acquaintances, we’re coworkers, we’re exes. we are more than subscriptions, we’re a community and your the ones holding us together, you built this site from the ground up with joy laughter and entertainment for all through many years, don’t tear it down in one with greed.

Sincerely, Sarah",2023-01-07

"Netflix has a year to win me back.

I was an early subscriber to Netflix streaming, and went for years with little to no service cancellations. I loved it.

Then I had to let it go for a couple months, back in 2022. For financial reasons.

Well, someone hacked my account, changed the language, added 10 other accounts, resumed &amp; Upgraded my service…

 and Netflix blamed me.

Seriously they only offered THE DIFFERENCE in what I normally pay, not a full refund. Even though I was CLEARLY hacked &amp; had OBVIOUSLY ended my account a couple months back. When I said not to pay the differences my bank could handle it, they refunded that small amount anyway, and then tried to do a full refund after my bank put in a FRAUD CLAIM.

Like. The app is fine. Im mildy interested in the game library that didn’t exist last time I had the service. They are the trailblazers of streaming, and the app still reflects that.

The quality is there. But don’t fall in love with their shows cuz they might get cancelled, and watch your bank account for charges you didn’t authorize.",2023-01-05
"This streaming platform had already started to lose a lot of quality shows and fill up with very low quality, low rated movies and TV shows. The streaming platform began relying on a few shows like Stranger Things to hold it together (especially after certain shows like breaking bad ended or the walking dead which kind of fell off). The household feature, however, is the reason I’m leaving this review. I am a college student living several hours away from my family and it doesn’t take this into account. It would rather force me or my family to pay double for this platform which already went up in price to 16 dollars. I’ve seen you can add another person for 8 dollars but it isn’t worth spending over 20 dollars a month when there’s plenty of other platforms that allow both my family and I to stream shows. The least they could have done was limited log ins to a certain number of devices. Honestly it was greedy of them and I can’t help but think it was an act of desperation due to other streaming platforms offering better content.",2023-01-08
"I don’t want to sound entitled or anything you know I love netflix, however the pricing netflix offers now is truly absurd for what little shows and movies we get. i understand that other services take the rights to certain films and series so they have no choice but the pricing is ridiculous majority of peoples favorite shows are gone or are yet to leave soon anyway why not lower pricing.

Also I do have one request will netflix ever offer custom profiles been wanting it from quite sometime since hbo does it. since perhaps you’re going to charge people an arm or leg for this app and for “cheaper” pricing you lock half of the films and give ads. and the fact that people get charged for sharing passwords is just.. whew

least you can do is offer some new features or something yk atleast with other services they offer discounts and addons you’ll get that for way cheaper than netflix offers.

But bless you all in the future!💗",2023-01-07
"This app is really good I really enjoy being able to watch my favorite Netflix shows no matter where I am. How ever I have not been able to find some of my favorite shows that I just took a little break from and so far I’m going towards the conclusion that they took it off Netflix, so pls stop taking shows off of Netflix because some of the shows don’t have the full episodes on YouTube and then some of the shows are in apps that I don’t have or have to pay for. If you do travel a lot though or even if you just want to watch Netflix a lot like me then this is a great app for you. Also sometimes the app glitches and just closes all of the sudden in the middle of me watching Ching my show or something and it has done that a few times and it’s really annoying when it just keeps doing it.",2023-01-07
"Hi
I have been on Netflix for a long time, I have seen many updates go by and let me just say, All these updates are bad. I just want to watch Netflix on the go but I cannot because we can’t download anything anymore which makes Netflix worthless. And the worse part is there are starting to be adds now. Before all these modern updates Netflix used to be great now we can’t download anything and there are adds even though paying for even one subscription is expensive and we don’t even get the luxuries we used to have. This is why Netflix isn’t doing as good anymore I know at least half my friends stopped using Netflix just because of this reason and now I am writing because it is an Inconvenience for me now please try and fix this problem make Netflix better again.",2023-01-05
"First off, the app is just fine. Usability has become better throughout the years. I like the home page being the new &amp; hot section, it gets my eyes on what’s new. I love the “loved this” ranking.
I love the variety of shows put out. BUT…
STOP CANCELING SHOWS!!! Seriously, each new show I watch, I google for the second season and it’s, yet, another show that’s been cancelled!! THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING!!
Or at least add a section to filter by more than one season.

—Here’s just something to think about— most of us are finishing up our binge watching of one show before moving on to another show. Maybe consider giving it more time before canceling it. It’s going to cause me to cancel my subscription, my friends have all said the same thing too.",2023-01-06
"I have had Netflix since it was DVDs in the mail. Once they implemented their password sharing policy, they told me how to get around it for my lake home using the traveling feature. It has been nothing but an absolute nightmare! They tell you to log into your Netflix at home watch some thing and then log into your second home and watch some thing and then magically you should be able to watch it at your second home. That is absolutely not the case, no matter what you do, no matter how many hours you spend on Netflix Support, all it will allow you to do is change the household to your second home, which will block Netflix at your main home or you can pay $7.99 to add an additional user. At this point Netflix does not deserve my business anymore.",2023-01-07
"You do know there’s households who are co parenting and use different wifi’s now we aren’t able to use the service do to this change. Thank you Netflix for making it impossible for my kids to not enjoy their shows. What were you expecting when you guys made this move? Please make an option so my kids don’t lose out. It’s bad enough we are a split household, don’t take this away from them. Your prices went up then this. This isn’t workable. You would think you guys would be a little mindful when you did this. But in all honesty it will cost you in the end. In case you haven’t already read the comments your subscribers wrote you. Please make this work.
I wish I could give you a positive review. But this doesn’t even deserve a star. Nice let down.",2023-01-08
"There is a bug on Netflix app on the Roku TV, TCL can you please put a software update for Netflix app and always put a software update for the Netflix app on the Roku TV. Every time you put a software update on iPhone that use the Roku TV when I watch Netflix and this is the only place that can report it because there’s no option to report it on the Roku TV every time you put a software update for. The iPhone you always put a software update for Netflix for the Roku TV. TCL. Sometimes when I’m on Netflix, sometimes it kicks me on the app and go to home screen there is a bug on the Netflix app needs to be fixed. On the Roku TV. Please fix it so that the Netflix app will always function properly and work properly on the Roku TV 100%.",2023-01-05
"Ever since I updated to TVOS 17 on my 4 gen appleTV pause does not work correctly in Netflix. This glitch does not happen in any other app, only Netflix. I have tried updating Netflix to no avail. This issue is more than a week old.

When I press pause the audio mutes but playback continues. If I press menu to leave the show it doesn’t remember my watch history so when I restart the show or film it goes back to the beginning. Jogging doesn’t work to fast forward either, so the only thing that works is using the 10 second jump to either go forwards through the show to where I left off, or let let the muted playback go and use the 10 second skip to go back to where I intended to pause.",2023-01-08
You guys are ready to loose us… we’ve been loyal customers since you sent video cassettes in the mail. There are plenty other ways to get shows. We have not abused your service yet I can’t sign in while caring for my brother at my parents house. My husband is out watching the game and can’t get the emailed code or whatever. I have our account on my phone but it won’t go on the tv here. It’s just me and my husband but sometimes I have to be in a different place because of disabled family members requiring my presence. My husband likes the other entertainment apps better but I told him I liked Netflix but we have to trim down our subscriptions… guess who’s on the chopping block!,2023-01-03
"I am a college student that literally lives 40 minutes away from “my household”, yet Netflix still seems it pertinent that I pay for my own separate account even though my parents pay for the separate screens plan. This is ridiculous and if I can’t find a way around it we will be deleting our membership. You complain that your business is losing money from sharing passwords yet a quick Google search will reveal that y’all made $32.12 Billion for the last 12 months, a 3.56% increase from the previous year. It shouldn’t even be considered “sharing a password” when it’s with your own family. Stop the dramatics about net revenue and get rid of this new “feature”!",2023-01-01
"Okay so me and my mother have had Netflix since I was in I believe 4th grade ,but now it’s starting to get really outrageous because first we had a reasonable price for only a  2 screen plan then had to have only one screen plan ,and now the plan we had was unnecessarily cancelled because I believe people are starting to stop watching regular tv I think &amp; now prices are going up not cool I mean I understand why stuff has to be paid for ,but what I don’t understand is why some have to be so expensive anyway what I’m getting at is that I really hate how Netflix is having these unnecessary changes when some things are perfect just the way they are",2023-01-05
"We no longer have a family account due to the password sharing rules. The extra cost to allow other people to use the account would strain our already limited finances. I also learned the hard way that we now can only have ONE PERSON watching a show at a time, even though we’re in the same household. I was trying to watch a show with my long distance friend and I couldn’t because of this. Also, not only do they keep canceling good shows, but they keep removing my favorites. If I was in charge of the subscription  I would’ve already cancelled it, this isn’t worth it anymore. And during a time where everyone is struggling financially? Greedy.",2023-01-05
"Unfortunately the latest update renders a very unfriendly glitch that causes the selected movie or series to immediately stream without ever having pressed the play button. Especially problematic when trying to read the synopsis or scroll down to view see the trailer. Contacted Netflix and was informed that the glitch is intentional on all smart tv’s as part of the experience. Brilliant! Congratulations Netflix, you’ve devolved into a mediocre app offering a crappy viewing experience for watching content that is becoming increasingly less than satisfactory. Way to attract and retain viewership!",2023-01-07
"If I could give 0 stars I would. My family has used Netflix for over 7 years but recently with their “password sharing” rules it is no longer worth the money in my opinion. You pay almost $16/month for mediocre shows and movies and if you are a college student living away from home, you’re considered no longer a part of the house hold and required to pay $7.99/month on top of the standard cost just to be able to watch it on your tv. The only reason I’d watch is for the 2 actually good tv shows they put out once a year. Save your money and use other platforms that are more worth it.",2023-01-07
"Stop trying to make more money this way. I have been using the same tv, WiFi, and house for over 5 years and randomly this update will tell me that my tv isn’t a part of my household. First of all, yes it is and it has been for forever, second of all, so what if it isn’t?? Why can’t we share accounts? Just because Netflix wants more money doesn’t mean your users should have to suffer. This is by far the dumbest update from Netflix and should be discontinued or at least be more effective to the tvs who actually aren’t in my household not messing up the ones that are.",2023-01-05
"My sister and I are living at two different colleges, and our parents are divorced so we have 2 homes. A family of 4 now has to spend $52 a month to each watch Netflix. FIFTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH ARE YOU FOR REAL???? You’ll be lucky if you have a company at all in 10 years time you moronic piece of capitalism trash. Price breakdown: Premium account allows 2 additional members that’s 3 people for $36, and 1 more standard account is $16 = $52 for 4 people). Netflix Managment I wish each of you nothing but pain, hardship, and misery for years to come. - Love, Sydney",2023-01-07
"The good movies/series are getting removed. Like Fast &amp; Furious ( Tokyo Drift ) and Fast &amp; Furious. It’s okay to remove some shows but you guys need to stop removing the classics and the good ones. When someone watches it people are gonna get hooked too and would wanna watch it for themselves. And they’re gonna ask where to watch it. If you say HBO Max or Hulu or something, people might not watch it because they don’t have it or can’t get it. All they have is Netflix for that matter. So if you really want clicks or money don’t remove the good shows",2023-01-06
"I’ve set a pin so that the full library is not easily accessible by my children by TV remote. Worked fine for years. Today on my phone the PIN keyboard stopped working in an odd way the keyboard for pin entry is on landscape mode and NOT usable while my phone is in portrait mode. Rebooting phone. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn’t fix it. I tried messaging Netflix customer support and was told to talk to apple. I suspect it’s the Netflix update from 2 days ago has a bug. Hope they fix it soon.

"ok, this app is great and awesome because it’s fully free. But is it so great when finding what you wanna watch? yes, they ALWAYYYYS take out the good and the only shows/movies people want to watch, like what the? I understand people might think “how else are they gonna make money?” “they can’t give us the best app ever” I understand but they seriously have to take out the least popular ish ones. they’ve been making people upset over the good shows/ movies, but they actually have to make a downloaded feel welcomed and happy.",2023-01-05
"Hi. I like shows on Netflix but you keep trashing them and there’s a lot of good shows. Like Jinxed, it has the leaving soon on it. I love that show but you guys are cancel are cancelling all the good shows and leave the bad shows. I have a long history with some shows that I have been watching since I was 3. F.Y.I I'm 8 years old. So I've been watching a lot of good shows. I get that your getting rid of old shows like Sailor Moon
But that doesn’t affect me ‘cause I don’t that show but please, stop
removing shows! 🤬",2023-01-05
"The documentaries are skewed by who makes them. No real trusted impartial journalism anymore. Giving legitimacy to corrupt voices is wrong in any context without proper disclosure of the corruption (both ethical and moral are denied in some documentaries, yet their voices are heard as truth). New content is crap. The scripted “reality tv” market is overdone and gross. The price keeps going up while the content goes down. This is the streaming service I could do without and contemplating the relevance currently.",2023-01-05
Listen bruh my parents are divorced and they tryna use the same account AND YOU GUYS HAD A NEW UPDATE NOW WE CANT SHARE PASSWORDS but listen that’s not my point IM TRYINGG TO WATCH SOME MY LITTLE PONY AND I CANT AND MMY MOM DONT FEEL LIKE MAKING A ACCOUNT SO FIX THIS BEFORE I SUE YOU OK BRAH IM TRYNA HAVE A PEACEFUL DAY WATCINGG MY LITTLE PONY I’m sorry it had to go this way ok?

FIRST YOU GUYS SNITCH ON SOAP2DAY then u wanna say we have to be under the same wifi. you guys made a big mistake and i hope everyone stops using netflix because i sure will. i’ll be fine with my Hulu HBO and yt tv. you guys can be greedy all u want but you guys are just losing more money and i hope who ever is in charge fixes this because you guys are actually stupid.,2023-01-05
"The fact that netflix seriously has the nerve to kick me out of the app because “my tv is not a part of the account household.” For 1. If you don’t want the account to be shared, do not create the option to make multiple profiles. For 2. This app is nowhere near good enough for me to WANT to create an entire new account when my brother already pays for it. Most of the shows are crap, they never have anything good and when they do, they take it down. Overall, I’ll NEVER use this app again.",2023-01-02
"The new “household” system is completely bananas. Not only has Netflix massively reduced the number of decent titles available on their service, but they’ve also massively increased the price. On top of all of this, if I want to use my own account at a different house, I have to jump through hoops just to say I’m “traveling”. Really?

I’ve cancelled my account. Every single title on Netflix is available elsewhere for considerably cheaper and is far easier to access. Never going back!",2023-01-04
"Netflix was great while we had it but with the new member add on, I will be having to pay $14 extra a month just because my kids in college. It is beyond frustrating that we have to spend more money out of pocket and it makes netflix seems like a money hog. Very unfortunate that a multimillion dollar company is using our situation to make money off of. If you have kids that are in college or live away from home, Netflix is the last streaming platform I would recommend!",2023-01-07
"works really well. I wish I could have a filter available to make it easier to find English speaking content. It’s not what it was but still works and it’s very reliable streamer app. Just too much content not in my language which is English. It’s really time consuming trying to remember something is not English so you watch the trailers if there’s one available. Language filter is desperately needed, any regular user knows this. But will it happen, doubtful.",2023-01-05
Hey there is something wrong with this appl it’s no longer allowing you to forward rewind or pause when using this on Apple TV. What ends up happening is loss of volume and sound and you have to restart show all over again from beginning so you have to end up watching it multiple times to see parts where you missed a scene because you can no longer pause or go back. Very annoying so I have stopped watching Netflix until this gets fixed. Thank you,2023-01-03
"Due to their new anti password sharing update I cannot watch their poorly scripted Netflix originals with bad costume designs simply because I am away for college. What is the point of having a MOBILE app if you cannot be MOBILE with the app.  If someone is paying for 5 screens/ profiles, who cares which screens they are and where they are being used. Netflix is not that good for me to pay for my own account so I guess this is the end of an era.",2023-01-05
"Everything in life is a subscription now these days. We all chipped in to lessen the cost of Netflix and enjoy it, now we have to ether pay way more, or go solo with it. With everything else people have to pay for, this was one that was enjoyable, because people helped and made it the best and cheapest streaming service. Is it a lot of money? No. Does it add up when you have no choice but to subscribe to everything else in life? Absolutely.",2023-01-05
"this update seems super inconsiderate to customers. they’re increasing the cost &amp; dictating where you can and can’t use this service. it doesn’t make sense, if you are paying the full price you should have the freedom to watch wherever you are. they’re forgetting that the people are the ones keeping them in business, not their terrible shows. there are so many better streaming services, netflix has fallen so far from what it used to be",2023-01-02
"This whole change to who can watch and where is really money hungry. My family pays the premium membership but would have to pay extra because I’m in college away from home?

So i was watching total drama and i got off of it to play with my younger sister and i go on and when i clicked it it showed me the episode before i got off of it so i skipped it and i was half way through the episode so now i have to start it again.

I’m very much NOT liking the new update of only being able to use the same account in the same household. My parents live separately and we all use our family account still!

It’s a waste and it’s by far the WORST decision you guys have had to make!!!!,2023-01-05
They changed their policies to only having one account in one household but if you upgrade they can charge you more for multiple household but this upgrade still doesn’t work. We still cannot use the same account in different household. Netflix just keeps getting worse. We’re tired and just canceling subscription . I’d recommend using different streaming services,2023-01-06
"Switched from watching in living room to watching in bedroom as I’m going to bed and Netflix asks me to upgrade to 2 accounts.  Won’t let me watch anything.  I thought you had the best engineers.

The status bar time and battery persists while viewing episodic content. It hides automatically while viewing movies. It hides automatically viewing videos on any other app also. So this is strictly a Netflix bug. I’ll happily change my rating to five stars when you guys fix it. Have to get your attention somehow 🤷‍♂️ This has gone on for far too long.,2023-01-03
Netflix has been great until recently. There’s no reason I should be paying for a family account and then my kids also hav3 to pay for their own Netflix account because they don’t still live with me.

I have always used Netflix. But tell me why I can’t watch Netflix at my home during the week and at my cabin on the weekends. I’m paying your overpriced fees. And yet I can’t use the service I PAY for because I own a business and travel on the weekends to it. What.  a.  joke. Wish I could give zero stars because that’s what it deserves.,2023-01-04
I mean like what’s the point of taking the movies down if your gonna put it back on after like millions of people pay like 30-50 dollars for a movie.Also you could be taking down someone childhood movie that they might have been watching since they were born like pls don’t take down anymore movies that you know have a good rating,2023-01-07
"I hate Netflix now, they keep removing actual good movies and shows I wanted to show my friend The Breakfast Club and Netflix removed it. There aren’t really any good shows or movies I do still watch some good ones (I recommend Kim’s Convenience) but I really wish they kept old movies and shows on there, Netflix is garbage now.",2023-01-07
Soooo the only reason I gave it a 3 and not a 1 is because they haven’t cancelled heartstopper but overall Netflix is going down hill fast because the prices are going up so they are losing business and then they think it’s because the movies are doing bad… THEY ARE NOT DOING BAD so that is my complaint:) have a nice day!!,2023-01-04
I will never believe a documentary that Netflix puts out again. The amount of info left out of Steven Avery case is unacceptable. Thankful that Candace Owens and the team set the record straight on Daily Wire. My faith in Manitowoc County Sheriffs is restored and my anger with Netflix deceiving us will not be forgotten!,2023-01-07
I had a family plan and share with my daughter who lives in a different city with her mother. The new password sharing policy means I can no longer use the family plan because we are not located in the same physical space. I’m spending too much on streaming anyway so Netflix made the cancel decision easy. Goodbye!,2023-01-01
"Ever since, they came up with the tracking of how many devices can login to the account. I been a customer since 2010 and got charged 26 last month, got hacked by their own system. Top it off It kicks me out from the same tv device and requires for me to change the password constantly. It’s becoming a headache!",2023-01-05
Netflix you have been my partner in crime but after THIS YEAH YOU BETTER KNOW I AM NOT YOUR BESTIE NO MORE. I was watching Netflix and I was thinking “oh I should watch home” I searched it up to see that is gonna leave.. ON MY BIRTHDAY?! My FAVORITE movie. Leaving on MY birthday. Netflix how could you..,2023-01-07
"I like Netflix, it’s pretty good but the only thing I don’t like about it is that you guys keep deleting shows. I can’t believe that you guys got rid of operation ouch I loved it so much and the only thing I can watch it on is on YouTube and my parents won’t let me on that but overall pretty dang good.",2023-01-07
I have to call my wife at while she is working and because I’m in a different time zone?  Just to use my Netflix that I pay for because it’s a different tv that I am streaming to are u f%^^ing kidding me?! You want money so I can stream to a smart tv while I’m traveling I’m done paying for this crap.,2023-01-06
I absolutely hate the way Netflix is constantly changing the cover art of movies. Every time I look they are using a different image for a movie I added to my list or am currently watching. Extremely irritating and makes me want to go back to watching DVDs in peace without all their distracting B.S.,2023-01-07
Netflix is great but they changed the settings so that you can only have the tvs in your house connected to your account. I am a college student that lives in a dorm and now can not use my parent’s account. This is very saddening because I am broke and will not be able to afford the subscription.,2023-01-03
"How can you charge 20 some odd dollars a month for mediocre woke TV shows, with a screen limitation, and THEN not even allow families to share accounts if they use separate internet? It’s 2023, no one’s making an account when they can get double the entertainment for half the price elsewhere.",2023-01-07
"I Loge Netflix so much but please add a pre-teen/teen section because after pg it goes pg 13 too tv-ma to R. I just want to have shows older kids can watch and it’s not that inappropriate

2nd thing: please add good shows and not like masha and the bear and Lyly crocodile

Hope this helps",2023-01-04
Now hear me out… you made it so that i can only watch netflix at my dads house and not my moms. not everybody got netflix money. It seems like that’s your way of saying you hate me and my mother and additionally you hate poor people. I’m beyond disappointed and disgusted at this behavior.,2023-01-02
This app is becoming horrible they took of mean girls and the Lorax and etc they are taking of all the good shows and movies Netflix is loading lots of people because people and ranting all over social media about Netflix and how horrible it is I don’t think I will be using it ever again.,2023-01-06
There was a time when y’all claimed password sharing didn’t effect your business and that you actually saw increase in customers. To see netflix (and other streaming services) begin a witch hunt for password sharers looks like customers are just gonna start moving back to cable tv.,2023-01-07
"I wish there were better options, the platform is tired, the app is terribly maintained, the organization topped the hill a decade ago. Let it go and move on to something worth your time and money because the price has gone far beyond being worth the absolute minimum effort put in.",2023-01-07
"I’m a paying customer, paying $15.99/month and this stupid company won’t let me watch inside my own home.  No matter what I do, their verification algorithm won’t let me confirm my TV, even though it’s on the same WiFi network.  Greedy Reed Hastings, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters.",2023-01-01
I pay for 5 users and Netflix will not let any of the other four access the account anymore because they all moved out of the house. This is Greed and Will lose me as a customer forever. Bedsides your movies have to much politically correct gay hollywood agenda. My wife agreed!,2023-01-08
So I tried to watch battle kitty and get to pick the levels and stuff. I tried my TV but it said my tv can’t do it. And now I tried it on my phone… Now it says that I need to “update” and i literally have it updated and it doesn’t need a update. PLEASE tell me how to do it 😭,2023-01-05
Overall GREAT App but I’m having problems getting in because I got logged out for some reason so if they could give information twice that would be better or just save the password and username but I could just  be stupid right now you don’t have to do it but I would like it,2023-01-07
"Bring back mini player mode please!
We often use Netflix while doing other things like paying bills or email or what not but after agreeing to have ads on our account, we can no longer use it that way. It does not allow you to have what you’re watching in mini player mode.",2023-01-06
You should not remove home. It is a good movie. It is the best movie even though I watch it once in a while I still love that movie and think it should be put on your app. This is my review and other people agree with it but I hope you take the decision to leave it there.,2023-01-07
"Pls do that Bc I like watching talking tom and friends and U TOOK SEASON ONE AWAY! So plsss do that Bc I like the show and wanna watch more episodes not just the same thing everyday so pls Netflix -ADD ALL TALKING TOM SEASONS
And DONT TAKE OUT KID DANGER ANG TALL GIRL",2023-01-07
"Not the app, but Netflix in general. Won’t let you watch it on another device in another house. For example, on vacation for a week at the beach in a condo. Can’t sign into Netflix on the TV in the condo because it’s not part of the household. Go F yourself Netflix.",2023-01-05
My Netflix app will not save where I am in a season every time I pause it takes me to a random episode in wrong season and I have to scroll and read every episode tab to find where I was at every time. Please if anyone has any advice how to fix it. Grateful 🤞,2023-01-04
GIVE ME BACK MY LORAX I BEEN WAITING AND WAITING FOR MY LORAX TO COME BACK ON HERE AND ITS STILL NOT WHY DID YOU EVEN TAKE IT OFF IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS IS WHY THAT PEACOCK APP IS BETTER BESIDES ALL THE ADS JUST PUT THE LORAX BACK ON NOW OR ELSE I WILL SUE,2023-01-06
Unless you have a brand new iOS device that can run iOS 16 or later you can’t use this app. It is absolutely useless and worthless if you do not have a brand spanking new Apple device. Absolutely outrageous. Thanks Netflix for the fraudulent bait and switch,2023-01-07
"For $19.99 a month Netflix has nothing compared to Hulu. I remember when Netflix had all the good shows Family Guy, The Simpsons all of that for a lower price. And the audacity to raise the price but not the quality of the shows?? Entitled and so greedy.",2023-01-05
"Hello, So I think you should add back some movies people actually liked here so the movies are Coraline,The Lorax,Mean girls,Friday and all the other Fridays.Because I was so sad when Netflix took those movies off and I liked the old Barbie movie’s too.",2023-01-07

"Netflix is new changes has been so annoying to deal with. Every night I sit down to watch on my tv it tells me my tv is not in the household. I don’t watch it anywhere else, no one else uses my account. It’s just annoying to deal with this constantly.",2023-01-04
Netflix has really gone downhill. Losing the rights to Disney movies and now I have to do a whole inconvenient process just to log in at a friends or family’s house. Not to mention their prices keep going up. Like it’s not even worth it anymore.,2023-01-07
"THIS APP DOES NOT HAVE JOAN OF ARC, I AM FEELING OFFENDED THAT THEY DONT HAVE RELIGOUS MOVIES FROM HISTORY. IF YOU LEAVE A GOOD REVIEW, GOOD FOR YOU. THIS APP ALSO SAYS THAT GINGERS DONT HAVE SOULS! US GINGERS HAVE FREAKIN’ SOULS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2023-01-03
I’ve never been so sad in my life taking off my girl first and now five feet apart no one needs some of these shows like no one watch’s half of those movies and you take both of the best made movies off I’ve never been so disappointed.😞,2023-01-03
make it make sense. to raise prices and then cut other households from watching. actually the most garbage and greedy industry. i'm going back to dvd's. you can actually share those. so disrespectful. i will never recommend netflix ever.,2023-01-05
Household makes no sense. You have to pay extra just for a “family” plan to do what its supposed to do. Not every family shares the same wifi 24/7. Basically they wanted to screw over half of their users just to make an extra buck.,2023-01-08
This is a really good app to watch movies and shows but the only thing you guys need to do is stop getting rid of really good movies! Why are you getting rid of them? Otherwise this is a great app to watch movies on if your bored.,2023-01-07
After being added to my mom’s account every couple of days I have to verify it through a QR code because it “forgot” I guess. Gonna tell mom to take my tv off the account because it’s honestly not worth the hassle at this point.,2023-01-05
It says my TV isn’t a part of my network and won’t work. It works on my phone. Sometimes updates make things worse and take away functionality. This is an example of that. Thanks for ruining my evening yet again! What a joke!,2023-01-03
They took the AirPlay feature off. This is so ridiculous as I travel for work and should be able to AirPlay since I can’t log in everywhere I go already. I hate this streaming service and hope it crashes and goes bankrupt,2023-01-01
THIS APP IS MY FAV BUT HERE IS SOME THINGS. PLZ ADD A TEEN SECTION BECAUSE ITS HARD FOR ME TO FIND THAT ARE FOR TEENS. And pls stop taking out good movies and put bad ones just plz read this and make this app go wild!,2023-01-05
